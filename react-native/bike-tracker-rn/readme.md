# bike tracker - react native

This app is used to keep track of expenses and kilometers traveled by bike, updating the ratio between them in real-time.
The project was developed to gain a basic understanding of React Native and the main paradigms of mobile app front-end development.

## Usage: 
* by tapping on the two buttons, a new value for kilometers or euros can be added to the current totals, automatically updating the ratio between them

## v1.0:
* basic ui
* basic interaction with components (buttons, dialog, state data manipulation)

## v1.1:
* more refined ui with bg image and styled components
* usage of AsyncStorage for permament data through sessions
* code optimization
